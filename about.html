        <h1><b style="font-size: 25px",>Hey, I am Bipin.</b> </h1>
        <p> I'm currently an undergraduate student pursuing a B.S. in Aerospace Engineering with a minor in Computer Programming. 
            My passion for flight drives my love for traveling, especially when it comes to airplane rides, which has led me to work towards earning my Private Pilot's License. 
            Alongside my interest in aviation, I'm also exploring the exciting fields of computer science, particularly machine learning and AI.
            <br></br>
            When I'm not studying or flying, I enjoy spending time in nature, capturing its beauty through photography. Staying active is important to me, so I make time for workouts and occasionally play soccer to unwind and relax. </p>
